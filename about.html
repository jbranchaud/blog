    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>I am a graduate research assistant at the
    <a href="http://cse.unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>
    working in the area of software engineering.</p>

    <p>In addition to engineering software by day, I also enjoy writing
    <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud">code</a> in my spare time.
    I play pool fervently including both 8 ball and 9 ball; I definitely
    prefer 9 ball.
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbranchaud/">Photography</a>
    has also been a passion of mine for many years.
    I have gained a recent affinity for broomball and I currently play
    on UNL's club Broomball team.
