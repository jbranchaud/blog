    <h1>About me</h1>

    <h2>I do research</h2>

    <p>
    I am a graduate research assistant studying computer science
    at the
    <a href="http://cse.unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>
    working in the area of software engineering.
    My research involves software development coordination and awareness
    issues as well as program analysis. Yeah, I know, those things don't
    really seem all that related, but bridging the gap has been
    interesting.
    Here are my <a
        href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/b/Branchaud:Joshua.html">
        publications</a>
    so far.
    </p>

    <h2>I write code</h2>

    <p>
    Writing code is fun which is probably why I do a lot of it in my
    free time. I have a variety of side projects that I host on
    <a href="http://github.com/jbranchaud">GitHub</a>. I grew up in
    Java land (which is where I am most proficient), but I am enamored
    with languages like python and ruby. In fact, I have been using
    python for most of my side projects lately.
    </p>

    <p>
    Jealousy of
    <a href="http://www.beerandcode.org/">Omaha's Beer && Code meetup</a>
    led <a href="https://twitter.com/_Branden">Branden</a> and myself to
    form a similar meetup in Lincoln which we have aptly named
    <a href="http://beerandco.de">Beer and Code</a>. It is a great
    opportunity for Lincoln-area developers to socialize, write code, and
    drink good beer.
    </p>

    <h2>I shoot photos</h2>

    <p>
    Photography has always been a passion of mine. Moving up from a
    simple point-and-shoot to a DSLR (Nikon D3100) has only encouraged
    the hobby. I host most of my photos on
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbranchaud/">Flickr</a>,
    but you can find me on
    <a href="http://500px.com/jbrancha">500px</a> as well.
    </p>

    <h2>I shoot pool</h2>

    <p>
    Though there was a pool table in my house for a number of years
    growing up, it wasn't until the last couple years that I really
    started to take the game seriously. I have now hosted three 8 ball
    leagues at the
    <a href="http://lincoln.nelcm.com/">Lutheran Center</a> and I also
    played in Lincoln's 2012-2013 Great Plains city pool league.
