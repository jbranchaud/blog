Last October I participated in a small hack-a-thon called HackOmaha. It was
my first event of that kind and a great experience. So much so that I
figured it would be good to write about in a blog post. I spent a little
time trying to collect my thoughts on the event, but never got around to
organizing them in a useful way. It would have been nice to extract some
gems from that experience and write them down somewhere concretely. Instead,
I got caught right back up into the rest of my schedule and let those
experiences slip by.

I am about to do the same thing with the KC Startup Weekend that I just
competed in this past weekend. It was one of the more challenging things I
have done. Trying to put together all the components of a viable weekend in
less than 54 hours was difficult to say the least. I walked away feeling
like I had learned a lot of general guidelines for being successful at a
startup weekend. I've scribbled down a few, but I'd like to push the rest
out in the form of a blog post for anyone's benefit.

Reflection is essential, but I rarely take time for it.
