*From Wikipedia, &copy; 2012 Hachette Book Group, Inc.*

Bossypants is a hilarious and thoughtful memoir that mainly covers
[Tina Fey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey)'s
adult life with bits and pieces of her childhood sprinkled in.
The book jumps back and forth through the ups and downs she experiences as
she chases after a career in writing and acting.

The book definitely seems aimed at a female audience, but is still
entertaining for men (or at least I found it entertaining). There is lots of
dry humor and absurd exaggerations like you might expect from the
creator of *[30 Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock)*.

If you are a fan of Tina Fey and/or *30 Rock*, then I expect you'll enjoy this
book. Consider it recommended!
