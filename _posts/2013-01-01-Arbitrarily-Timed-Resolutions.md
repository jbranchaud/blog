title: Arbitrarily Timed Resolutions (2013)
summary: A listing of my goals and resolutions for the year of 2013.

I've often been tempted to come up with a set of new year resolutions, but
it is usually around the 5th of January that I think to do so. Nearly a week
late and with little motivation, the thought comes and goes.

This year realizing that there are some real things I'd like to accomplish, I
actually thought ahead and was able to come up with a substantial, but
achievable set of goals. I will admit the following is rather ambitious, but
with the conviction garnered from this post and some perseverence I think it
can be done.

It is 2013. It is time for a year of kicking ass.

General
-------

- seek ways to become a better husband (not sure how this will manifest itself)
- find time to talk with my parents and sister more often (via skype, phone,
etc.)
- make sure to consistently spend quality time with friends
- build and stick to a financial budget with a focus on saving
- figure out what our next life step(s) will be once Erin and I are finished
with school
- reduce the waste I produce by composting more and buying foods/products with
less packaging

Health and Wellness
-------------------

- run three times per week (around 4 miles)
- complete the P90x program
- try out yoga
- make and drink fresh juice daily (a blend of fruits, yogurt, and spinach)
- replace most of the red meats in my diet with chicken
- quit drinking soda
- drink tea rather than coffee when possible

Programming
-----------

- continue to organize and go to [Beer and Code](http://beerandco.de) once a
month
- relearn a language: Haskell
- learn a new language: considering Clojure at this point
- do one fun mini project per month
- make some contributions to an open source project
- do two fun projects with the Raspberry Pi

Photography
-----------

- start a photo per day Flickr set for 2013 and add daily on schedule
- try really, really hard not to fall behind on the above and set aside time
every Sunday (if necessary) to play catch up
- upload an additional high quality photo to 500px weekly
- try showing some of my photography and see if there is anyone out there
interested in purchasing some of it
- invest in one or two new lenses
- learn some new photography techniques and tricks
- take time weekly to browse and critique quality photography (online)

Pool
----

- play a minimum of three games daily
- come up with a different skill to practice each day of the week to improve
upon my technique and confidence
- play in a tournament twice per month (most likely at Drifters)

Research and School
-------------------

- read a research paper and write a review weekly (this will end up being a
byproduct of the class I am taking anyway)
- get a paper published at a top tier software engineering conference
- get a workshop paper published at a top tier software engineering conference
- ace final class of master's degree
- write my master's thesis
- graduate from [UNL](http://unl.edu)'s master's program

Cooking
-------

- cook two new recipes per month
- learn about cooking gluten free and try a variety of gluten free recipes
- continue to cook more and more with organic and sustainable foods
- learn to cook healthier and appropriately portioned meals

Reading
-------

- read the newspaper (NYTimes) for 30 minutes daily
- read one fiction book per month
- read one nonfiction book per month
- read one technical book every two months

Writing
-------

- write two decent blog posts per month
- write extra *learn from my struggles* blog posts each month when applicable
- maintain a personal journal (handwritten and/or digital)
- participate in National Novel Writing Month (Nov.) and write a novel

Spiritual
---------

- set aside time for meditation and reflection each morning (10-20 minutes)
- attend morning prayer at the Lutheran Center daily (Monday through Friday)
- read from psalter daily (when should I do this?)

Productivity
------------

- check email with much less frequency and stop keeping a permanent email tab
open in the browser
- set aside daily time for HackerNews and other such distractions rather than
habitually checking them throughout the day
 

Misc.
-----

- learn how to home brew beer
- brew two types of beer over the course of the year
- beat Pandemic on its hardest difficulty

Some of these items need more detail such as when and how each will be accomplished.

Note to myself: *As the year progresses, trim out goals from this list that are no longer
feasible or of interest rather than becoming a slave to the list.*

Supplumentary content such as lists of books, recipies, and programming
resources will be added.
