In mid-August, I will be heading to
[either Argentina or Uruguay]({% post_url 2013-04-22-ArgentinaUruguay %})
with my wife to live and work for a year.

I am going to have to figure out how I will fit everything for that year
into two suitcases. That seems really challenging to me, especially when I
consider the sheer amount of *stuff* I have. This has left me contemplating
what it is that I will try to bring. It is going to be a year defined by
**living with less**.

How many outfits will I be able to bring? Which books will I want to read
this year? Which toiletries will I need to bring bulk of because they won't
have quite what I use? Should I bring a jar of peanut butter? What things am
I not thinking of that I will regret not bringing? What are the things that
I *really* need?

This is a fascinating mental exercise. Trying to pack all your things into
two suitcases makes you trim away the unnecessary fluff in your life. This
challenges the mindset of a
culture that tells you to never be satisfied with what's in front of you.

What if you had to trim your life down to the bare essentials?

What would those things be for you?

What if those things were enough?

I have no choice but to think these things through since I will eventually
have to make these decisions. I do, however, challenge you to think about
what it would mean for you if you had to condense your life into two
suitcases.
