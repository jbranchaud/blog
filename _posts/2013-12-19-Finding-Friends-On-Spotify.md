## The UX Breakdown

I am hesitant about this whole *social music revolution* thing that plenty
of companies like to think is happening. As if *social* is a close relative of
bacon, we seem to think we can wrap it around anything to improve it.
Unfortunately, I trust the musical taste and recommendations of about **3**
of my friends, so adding a *social* aspect to my music listening experience
is just going to create noise. I've had Spotify since day one of it becoming
available in the US and from day one I have been connected by email rather
than through Facebook. I don't want to see every song others are listening
to and I'd prefer not to subject them to the same. I am also not too keen on
Facebook having a grip on yet another one of my online interactions.

So, I am not connected to Spotify through Facebook, but I did mention those
three friends to which I wouldn't mind being connected. Simple enough, I
should just click the *Follow* menu item on the left.

That drops me into a screen with three tabs from which to choose. The first
is labeled *Who To Follow*. That sounds promising, there is probably a
search box for finding friends based on their user name. That doesn't appear
to be the case though. There is a section for my Facebook friends on Spotify
(but I am not connected through Facebook), followed by two sections for
finding all my favorite (?) artists.

Okay, but the second tab is labeled *Find Friends*. That has to be it, why
didn't I just start there? Perfect, there is that search box I was looking
for, though I am confused by the wording, *Filter by name*.
I type a friends username into the box and, after waiting on the spinning
loading icon for a few seconds, realize that nothing is going to show up.
Apparently this is just a place to *filter* the names of existing
friends... but that is only if I can figure out how to add them first.

Hmm... so how the hell do I search for non-Facebook friends that I am not
*already* connected to?!

The solutions turns out to be so elegantly subtle that no one would know
unless they were supposed to know. Obviously, I just need to know some
Spotify search bar syntax and I will quickly be on my way. In the main
Spotify search bar, I can type the following query with the username of interest
inserted in place of *username*:

    spotify:user:username

Hit enter and *boom, bam, pow*, I have that user I was looking for.
I better quickly click the *follow* button before I forget how to find them
again.
