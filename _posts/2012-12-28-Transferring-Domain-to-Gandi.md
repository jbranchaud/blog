title: Transferring a Domain Name to Gandi.net
summary: The steps I took to transfer my domain name from GoDaddy to Gandi.net

I recently decided to move [my main domain](http://joshbranchaud.com) from
GoDaddy to [Gandi.net](http://gandi.net) for a number of reasons.

When moving a domain name, the transfer process depends mostly on the new
registrar. Since I am moving to Gandi.net, I needed to use their
[transfer page](https://www.gandi.net/domain/transfer).

[Gandi's Transfer FAQ](http://wiki.gandi.net/en/domains/faq/transfer) helps
answer a number of questions and issues that may arise.

Additionally, GoDaddy has a
[support page](http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/3560/transferring-domain-names-to-another-registrar?pc_split_value=4)
explaining the process behind moving a domain to a new registrar.
