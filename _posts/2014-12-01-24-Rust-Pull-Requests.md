summary: I'm going to gift at least 24 pull requests in the next 24 days to the Rust community

Tis' the season to give back to open source.

The [24 Pull Requests](http://24pullrequests.com/) project has been around
for a couple years now. It encourages developers to give back to the open
source projects they have been using the past year by fixing bugs, adding
features, and updating documentation. The idea is to gift 24 pull requests
in the first 24 days of December.

I thought I might do things a little differently. I've been intrigued by
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/), an up and coming systems programming
language, as of late. So I thought, why not give to the community that I
hope to be apart of the coming year?

Over the next 24 days, I hope to contribute at least 1 pull request a day to
the Rust community whether that be to the Rust compiler, another crucial
library, or even just an interesting Rust project that another Rustacean is
working on.

I'll primarily track my progress at
[24PullRequests](http://24pullrequests.com/users/jbranchaud), but I'll also
try to write about my experiences whenever there is anything worth
mentioning.

Tis' the season to write some Rust.
