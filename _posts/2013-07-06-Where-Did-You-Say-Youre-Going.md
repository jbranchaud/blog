I announced a while back that Erin and I will be moving to either Argentina
or Uruguay in August. We have been asked fairly frequently which country it
will be. We've been equally curious about the answer to that same question
because the program coordinators
hadn't given us our official placement yet. However, they finally
revealed the answer.

We are excited to say that for the next year we will be living and working
in [Argentina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina).
More specifically, we will be in the
[greater Buenos Aires
area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Buenos_Aires)
in a city called [Grand Bourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bourg).

We will announce more details soon!

**Update:**

Erin recently wrote a post with more details about
[our placement in Argentina](http://joshanderin.com/2013/07/15/Our-Placement.html).
