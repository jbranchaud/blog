There are a lot of great options out there when it comes to music applications.
This is especially true for cloud-based music apps. The list is long, but the
ones I find myself using include
[Spotify](http://www.spotify.com),
[Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/),
[rdio](http://www.rdio.com/), and
[GrooveShark](http://grooveshark.com/).

And [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) as well.

SoundCloud is a bit different from the rest mentioned above. Rather than
streaming record labeled music that you can hear on the radio and find on
the multimedia-clad shelves of Target and Walmart, you get a whole new and
fresh music experience. It is chock full of home-grown, independent music
ranging from rock and alternative to dupstep and electronic. This is because
SoundCloud provides itself as a platform for musicians to upload and share
their music.

I am partial to the incredible mashups created by the large community of
mashup-artists on SoundCloud. Here are a few mashups that I would
recommend:

- [Counting Cavemen](https://soundcloud.com/djsleeper/sets/counting-cavemen/)
by [Sleeper](https://soundcloud.com/djsleeper)
- [Counting Lasers](https://soundcloud.com/djsleeper/dj-sleeper-counting-lazers)
by [Sleeper](https://soundcloud.com/djsleeper)
- [Alien Selection 2012 12 04](https://soundcloud.com/djsfrommars/2012-12-04-1)
by [djs from mars](https://soundcloud.com/djsfrommars)
- [Alien Selection 2012 09 27](https://soundcloud.com/djsfrommars/djs-from-mars-alien-5)
by [djs from mars](https://soundcloud.com/djsfrommars)
- [Palace Mix 071212 Part 1](https://soundcloud.com/paulcarass/palace-mix-071212-part-1)
by [Paul Carass](https://soundcloud.com/paulcarass)
- [Back to the Future Promo Mix](https://soundcloud.com/mashupgermany/mashup-germany-back-to-the-1)
by [Mashup-Germany](https://soundcloud.com/mashupgermany)

That first link (Counting Cavemen) is easily one of the best mashups I have
ever heard. It is about 2:30 hours long, but definitely worth the listen.

I find the mashups I listen to through the likes and recommendations of a
friend who takes the time to listen to and curate tons of them. Check out
his SoundCloud account -- [MashPotatoes](https://soundcloud.com/mashpotatoemusic).

So if you are looking to mix up your daily playlist a little, check out
SoundCloud. If you have any recommendations for me, tell me about it in the
