I went to my sister's commencement ceremony yesterday. She did a good job,
didn't trip on the way to getting her diploma or anything like that.

It was a long, drawn out day, so I filled some of the time by making some
observations.

- Most Popular Cliche Statement:
  > "It's not goodbye, it's see you later."

- People like to buy $1000 cameras and then never learn how to use them
  properly. Sorry, but the built-in flash is not going have any effect
  across an auditorium.

- Even if a commencement speaker states their intention to be brief, they
  will still speak forever.

- Every commencement speech must instruct the graduates to, *"Go change the
  world!"*

- Even with the pronunciation spelled out (*branch-awe*), no one will ever even come close
  to pronouncing our last name correctly.

Congratulations, Steph!

PS. Sorry for my cynicism.
