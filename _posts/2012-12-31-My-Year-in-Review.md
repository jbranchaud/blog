summary: A brief review of this year's happenings worth remembering.

I did not originally intend to write a *Year in Review* post, but realized
it would be nice to throw one together if for no other reason than to assist
myself in remembering what was significant to me in 2012. It is good to reflect
on these sorts of things anyway as I prepare my goals for 2013.

This year really has been a busy, rewarding, and incredibly exciting time.

- I completed 2 semesters of my master's degree
- I had an internship with the
[National Institute of Aerospace](http://www.nianet.org/)
at [NASA Langley](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html)
in Virginia.
- I had a paper accepted for publication in the proceedings of
the [International Conference on Software Maintenance](http://selab.fbk.eu/icsm2012/) (ICSM)
- I was able to attend ICSM in Riva del Garda, Italy
- I competed in and won [HackOmaha](http://hackomaha.com/) 2012 with
a talented group of guys from the Omaha/Lincoln area
- I am helping reignite [Beer and Code](http://beerandco.de)
in Lincoln, NE
- I purchased a Nikon D3100 in March and have become a much better photographer
since then
- I've significantly improved my pool skills (8ball and 9ball), played in a
bunch of small 9ball tournaments, and started competing in a city 8ball league
- I helped organize two very successful 8ball leagues/tournaments at UNL's
Lutheran Center
- My best man, Jason, threw me an awesome bachealor party which included
a tour of the [Boulevard Brewing Company](http://www.boulevard.com/)
in Kansas City
- And the big one, I got married (on Sept. 8, 2012)!

And some sour notes:

- I did not read nearly as many books as I would have liked
- I really didn't challenge my programming skills much until the last couple
months of the year. More side projects and open source involvement would have
been nice
- I wish I would have cooked more and learned a bunch of new recipes
- I utterly failed at creating and maintaining any sort of financial budget
- I was incapable of sticking to a consistent exercise routine
- I didn't participate in any races. I would have liked to have done at least
one half marathon
- I got really off track on posting my daily photos

Rather than regretting the year's shortcomings, I harness them as motivation
as I head into the New Year with new and old goals in mind.
