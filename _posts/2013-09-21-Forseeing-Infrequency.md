title: Forseeing Infrequency
summary: a year in Argentina means I probably won't be blogging here too frequently
---

Grand Bourg, Argentina is a medium-sized city just an hour northwest of the
city center of Buenos Aires. It is where I am living for the next
year as of August (with my wife, of course). We are here to accompany a
church, school, home for the elderly, and a vocational center for adults who
are differently abled. Our days are rather busy and our access to internet
is often random. As such, I forsee that my posts to this blog will be rather
infrequent this year.

We are trying to write about our experiences when we find the time at
