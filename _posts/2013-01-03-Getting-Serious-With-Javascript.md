[Hudl](http://www.hudl.com/) recently hosted a developer meetup with a talk
given by [Matt Steele](http://matthewsteele.wordpress.com/). The talk was
titled *Treating JavaScript Like a Real Language* with an alternative title of
*What Zelda taught me about Front End Engineering*.

The crux of the talk had to do with the inherent challenges and perils of
JavaScript and the necessity to treat it as a real language by using the kinds
of tools and tricks of the trade that we employ with other languages like Java,
C++, etc. It was an engaging talk with a whirlwind of technologies and tools,
so I thought I would take this opportunity to transcribe the tools and 
technologies into a blog post.

Development and Syntax
----------------------

- [Zen-Coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/) - a new way of writing
HTML and CSS code
- [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) - the JavaScript code quality tool
- [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) - another JavaScript code quality tool
- [JSHint Platforms](http://www.jshint.com/platforms/) - plugins and resources
for Vim and everything else
- [Lint JavaScript on Commit](http://nicknisi.com/blog/blog/2012/11/12/lint-javascript-on-commit/)

Testing
-------

- [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) -
a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code
- [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/) - Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks
for JavaScript. No dependencies, works with any unit testing framework.
- [JS-ImageDiff](https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/js-imagediff) - 
JavaScript / Canvas based image diff utility with Jasmine matchers for testing
canvas

Build Tools
-----------

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - a task-based command line build tool for
JavaScript projects
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) - a robust and opinionated set of tools,
libraries, and a workflow that can help developers quickly build beautiful,
compelling web apps
- [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) - an open-source continuous integration
server

Resources
---------

- [js-assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment) - 
a test-driven approach to assessing JS skills
- [Paul Irish's Frontend Bundle](http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user/11165870484951445324/bundle/frontend) - 
Frontend development exploration, techniques, tips. Lots of JavaScript
- [MDN on JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript) - 
documentation, tutorials, articles, and resources curated by the Mozilla
Developer Network
- [WebPlatform.org](http://www.webplatform.org/) - 
an open community of developers building resources for a better web

Books
-----

- [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-David-Flanagan/dp/0596000480)
- [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)
- [JavaScript Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752)

Beyond JavaScript
-----------------

- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - a little language that compiles
into JavaScript
- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a typed superset of JavaScript
that compiles to plain JavaScript for application-scale JavaScript development

Check out the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/mattdsteele/what-zelda-taught-me-about-front-end-engineering)
from the talk as well as the [video](http://vimeo.com/54993676) of the talk.

Do you do a lot of JavaScript? Have we neglected to mention something that you
would swear by? Leave a comment!
