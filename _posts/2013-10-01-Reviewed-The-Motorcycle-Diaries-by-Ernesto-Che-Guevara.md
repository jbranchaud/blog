This is a book I had been intending to read for quite some time, but did not get
around to doing so until I actually found myself living in Argentina
near the very place where
Guevara's adventures began. It is a beautifully written book with nothing
held back as Guevara shares even the most intimate of thoughts. Each page
gives a glimpse into the beauty of South America from the valuable
perspective of a South American, but no words are minced when it comes to
pointing out the brokeness and explotation.

I found myself wishing I had half the adventurous spirit as Guevara (and
especially at the age of 23). Don't put it off like I did, read this book.
