Erin and I recently applied for [Young Adults in Global Mission (YAGM)](http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Global-Mission/Engage-in-Global-Mission/Global-Service/Basics-of-Global-Service/Young-Adults.aspx)
through the ELCA. YAGM is a year-long service program similar in some ways
to the Peace Corp. They suggested we interview for either the
Argentina/Uruguay country program or the Southern Africa country program.

This past weekend we interviewed for both. They offered us placement for the
Argentina/Uruguay program.

We accepted.

Later this summer we will find out exactly where in either Argentina or
Uruguay we will be placed and what we can expect to be doing there. Once I
find out more details, I will post them.
