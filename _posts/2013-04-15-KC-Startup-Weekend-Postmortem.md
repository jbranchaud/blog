A few weeks ago, I was struck with an interesting idea that I thought would
be worth pitching at a startup weekend. After missing Lincoln's startup
weekend, I started looking for another one close by in both time and space.

Enter [KC Startup Weekend](http://kansascity.startupweekend.org/)

I am not much of a public speaker, but I mustered up the courage to pitch my
idea to this room of random people. It was a surprisingly encouraging and
fun-loving crowd.

After [26
pitches](http://threecocktaillunch.com/2013/04/13/the-first-round-of-biz-pitches-at-kansas-city-startup-weekend-7/),
a round of sticky-note voting snuck me into the ranks of [11 competing
teams](http://threecocktaillunch.com/2013/04/13/the-1-finalist-startup-ideas-at-kansas-city-startup-weekend-7/).

Gitalytics, a visual dashboard for software developers and project managers,
now had a chance to become a reality.

During the team formation phase, I was lucky enough to convince two
extremely talented guys to join forces with me. [Wes
Mikel](https://twitter.com/wesmikel), a graphic designer and data
visualization guy, pitched a powerpoint/prezi killer, but the data
visualization focus of our idea was too enticing to resist.
[Erik Wullschleger](https://twitter.com/ejdub), a marketing specialist, was
between teams for a bit, but we eventually swayed him our way.

Lastly, a big thanks to [@neight](https://twitter.com/neight) and all the
other volunteers that put together such an awesome and seamless startup
weekend experience.
